# still busy; a single-key user has nothing to rotate to).  Some providers
# (notably Z.AI / Zhipu) reuse HTTP 429 for server-wide overload, so the 429
# status path matches the body against this list before falling through to

# transport-recovery path resets the counter and does it again, producing

# OpenRouter aggregator policy-block patterns.

# When a user's OpenRouter account privacy setting (or a per-request

# serving a model, OpenRouter returns 404 with a *specific* message that is
# distinct from "model not found":
#
#   "No endpoints available matching your guardrail restrictions and
#    data policy. Configure: https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy"
#
# We classify this as `provider_policy_blocked` rather than
# `model_not_found` because:
#   - The model *exists* — model_not_found is misleading in logs
#   - Provider fallback won't help: the account-level setting applies to
#     every call on the same OpenRouter account

# Provider content-policy / safety-filter blocks. Distinct from

# request, so retrying the same prompt three times just reproduces the same
# block and burns paid attempts on a refusal. The recovery is to switch to a
# configured fallback model/provider immediately, or surface the block to
# the user with actionable guidance if no fallback exists.
#
# Patterns are intentionally narrow — each phrase is a verbatim string from
# a specific provider's safety pipeline, not a generic word like "policy" or
# "violation" that could collide with billing/auth/format errors:
#   • OpenAI Codex cybersecurity refusal (gpt-5.5, the case from #18028)
#   • OpenAI moderation refusal ("violates our usage policies", with
